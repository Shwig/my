## my shell 

NAME
      myshell

DESCRIPTION
      myshell is a custom built interactive command language
      interpreter that executes commands taken
      from the standard input. Myshell is also compatible
      with all basic sh commands currently excluding I/O redirection
      and piping.

INVOCATION
      First run the makefile included in the package.
      when the executable myshell program is invoked from the command line
      it first sets the env of the shell using the path to the myshell executable.
      The shell will then remain in interactive mode waiting for user input
      until the 'quit' command is entered.

BASIC COMMANDS
      quit - terminate the my_shell program

      clr - clears all previous input from the shell window

      dir - list all contents of current directory

      cd <directory path> - cd without a directory path arg will report the
      current directory to std_out, adding an arg changes to the input directory path

      environ - lists all of the current environment variables in PATH

      echo <string> - send input string to std out

      help - display all valid commands accepted by my_shell
